    Connect your PC to the same WiFi network as your phone and open any presentation (PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.).
    <br/>
    Keep this desktop companion app open in background. Make sure it is running before you start the mobile app.
    <br/>
    You should then be able to open the mobile app, start Presentation Mode by tapping the big play button and control the presentation via WiFi.
    <br/><br/>
    If it doesn't work, make sure you have granted the app the necessary permissions,
    close/disconnect everything and repeat the steps above.
